# Introduction
These scripts were used to do some preliminary analyses in the multi flip angle data shared by University of Alahabad.

The scripts are created with the following in mind:

1) PRJDIR contains the project directory

2) Within the project directory data is expected to reside in folder PrcsData

3) Inside PrcsData there is one directory per subject

4) Original EPI and T1 Data are expected to be in D00_OriginalData

5) Preprocessing of T1 datasets will occur in D01_Anatomical

6) Preprocessing of EPI data will occur in a different directory per flip angle : D03_Preproc_NoRICOR_FIR_${FA}

7) There are two type of scripts: bash scripts and jupyter notebooks
